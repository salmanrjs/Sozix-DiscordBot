# Discord Bot â€“ Basic Bot with Ping, Avatar, and Clear Commands

A simple Discord bot built using Python and `discord.py`.  
It responds to basic commands to help with server interaction.

## Features
- `!ping`: Replies with the current bot latency (ping).
- `!avatar`: Shows the profile picture (avatar) of a mentioned user or yourself.
- `!clear`: Clears a specified number of messages in the chat.
- `!help`: Lists all available commands.


## How to Run
1. Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt


2. Add your Discord bot token in the bot script (`main.py` or wherever you store it).

3. Run the bot



## Notes
- Make sure your bot has the necessary permissions to read messages, send messages, and manage messages (for the clear command).
- Replace placeholder tokens and IDs with your actual bot information.
